We want to create a web site to estimate the best price for an apartment/room per night. The user enters the location, type of the accommodation, date and some more parameters about the apartment and immediately gets the estimated price. Initially the model will be trained based on Airbnb open dataset. This product can be used by the host owner to get the best revenue from his/her apartment or by travelers to check whether the price for accommodation is adequate.
